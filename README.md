# Eriks-Wasp-Sim
This project holds all my work on the (yellowjacket) wasp colony simulator.

## Dependencies
If you just want to run the program, clone the repo and use the [executable](Eriks_Wasp_Sim/build/vs2022/x64/Debug/Eriks_Wasp_Sim.exe) in the "/Eriks_Wasp_Sim/build/vs2022/x64/Debug/" directory.

It will not work if you remove it from that directory.


If you want to compile the source code, you will have to download the following dependencies and put them into the "/Eriks_Wasp_Sim/dependencies" directory:

- [tinyobjloader](https://github.com/tinyobjloader/tinyobjloader): Put "tiny_obj_loader.h" into "/Eriks_Wasp_Sim/dependencies"
- [glew-2.1.0](https://sourceforge.net/projects/glew/files/glew/2.1.0/): Put the "glew-2.1.0" directory into "/Eriks_Wasp_Sim/dependencies"
- [freeglut](https://www.transmissionzero.co.uk/software/freeglut-devel/): Download the MinGW Package and then put the "freeglut" directory into "/Eriks_Wasp_Sim/dependencies"
- [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm/releases): Download the glm folder and put it into "/Eriks_Wasp_Sim/dependencies"
